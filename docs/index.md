## What is this?
This is a mkdocs mirror of the Google Test and Google Mock github repos to make the documentation easier to read.

## Is this made by Google?
Nope, this is completely unconnected with Google except in the content provided. I just threw this together because I was getting annoyed browsing locally or via GitHub to look at the docs.

## Is this up to date?
Yes, if by up to date you mean up to date with the master branch. The mirror pulls from the google test repo daily on the [master branch](https://github.com/google/googletest) only.

*8-26-19: Google Mock changed their documentation pages and since then, the mock side has been broken. This has now been fixed. Sorry for the inconvenience.*

## So... Where are the docs exactly?
Sidebar on your left <=

## Who are you?
Not important.

## Yeah, but like, what if you're mining my data or something?
Ok, fine. This is hosted on GitHub and is entirely open source. See it [here](https://github.com/gunslingerfry/googletest) and [here](https://github.com/gunslingerfry/google-test-docs). It [_should_](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/compliance/) comply with [GPDPDR](https://www.google.com/search?q=GPDR) or whatever.
